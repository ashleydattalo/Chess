PROJECT TITLE: Chess Game
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: I enjoy playing chess, and I wanted to see if I could create my own version of chess.
AUTHORS: Ashley Dattalo
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Clone the repository onto your local computer. Then open the project (I used BlueJ), and click run applet on ChessGame.java

Side Note: This project is not quite finished. The pawns are missing from the visualization, because after refactoring, I havenâ€™t rewritten the Pawn class.
